# Far From Home

### About this project
"Far From Home" is a project that I started during my third year of the B.Tech program. This project was developed keeping in mind how can we replace the broker system with a modern and open-source approach. Using this platform Owners can post their house advertisements and Tenants can search for a house/apartment available for rent of their choice at one place. The app also has a feature to integrate payment API for rent and deposit payments so that the Owners did not worry about going and physically collecting rent of each and every apartment regularly.
